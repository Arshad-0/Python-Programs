# Python-Programs

## üìö Overview

Welcome to the **Python-Programs** repository! This collection comprises a variety of Python scripts that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. It's an excellent resource for beginners aiming to understand basic Python programming through practical examples.

## üß† Contents

The repository includes scripts on:

* **Mathematical Operations**: Calculating factorials, determining prime numbers, computing the area of a triangle, and finding the maximum of three numbers.
* **Control Structures**: Implementations using loops (`while`), conditional statements (`if-else`), and more.
* **Data Structures**: Working with arrays, dictionaries, and lists.
* **Games and Simulations**: Simple games like "Guess the Number" and "Stone-Paper-Scissors".
* **Miscellaneous**: Scripts demonstrating the use of modules like `pandas`, `turtle`, and more.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

Here's a brief overview of some notable scripts:

* `Factorial.py`: Calculates the factorial of a given number.
* `Primenumber.py`: Checks whether a number is prime.
* `area_of_triangle.py`: Computes the area of a triangle given its sides.
* `guess_the_number.py`: A simple number guessing game.
* `stone_paper_seasor.py`: Implements the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
* `pandas.py`: Demonstrates basic usage of the pandas library.
* `turtle.py`: Uses the turtle module for simple graphics.

*(Note: The above list is not exhaustive. Refer to the repository for the complete set of scripts.)*
